Short helpfile for action CLUSTER_WITHSURFACE
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

               CLUSTERS - the label of the action that does the clustering 
              RCUT_SURF - you also have the option to find the atoms on the surface 
                          of the cluster. An atom must be within this distance of one of 
                          the atoms of the cluster in order to be considered a surface 
                          atom 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation
