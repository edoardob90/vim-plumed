Short helpfile for action DIMER
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - The list of atoms being considered by this CV. Used if 
                          ALLATOMS flag is missing. For more information on how to specify 
                          lists of atoms see \ref Group 
                 NATOMS - The number of dimerized atoms. Used in combination with 
                          ATOMS list. For more information on how to specify lists of atoms 
                          see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 DSIGMA - The interaction strength of the dimer bond. 
                      Q - The exponent of the dimer potential. 
                   TEMP - The temperature (in Kelvin) of the simulation. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
               ALLATOMS - ( default=off ) Use EVERY atom of the system. Overrides 
                          ATOMS keyword. 
               NOVSITES - ( default=off ) If present the configuration is without 
                          virtual sites at the centroids.
