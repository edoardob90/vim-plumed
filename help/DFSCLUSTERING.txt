Short helpfile for action DFSCLUSTERING
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 MATRIX - the action that calcualtes the adjacency matrix vessel we 
                          would like to analyse 
             MAXCONNECT - ( default=0 ) maximum number of connections that can be 
                          formed by any given node in the graph. By default this is set 
                          equal to zero and the number of connections is set equal to the 
                          number of nodes. You only really need to set this if you are 
                          working with a very large system and memory is at a premium 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation
