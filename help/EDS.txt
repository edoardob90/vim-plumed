****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                  RANGE - ( default=3.0 ) The largest magnitude of the force constant 
                          which one expects (in kBT) for each CV based 
                   SEED - ( default=0 ) Seed for random order of changing bias 
                   INIT - ( default=0 ) Starting value for coupling constant 
                  FIXED - ( default=0 ) Fixed target values for coupling constant. 
                          Non-adaptive. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                   RAMP - ( default=off ) Slowly increase bias constant to a fixed 
                          value 
                  COVAR - ( default=off ) Utilize the covariance matrix when updating 
                          the bias. Default Off, but may be enabled due to other options 
                 FREEZE - ( default=off ) Fix bias at current level (only used for 
                          restarting). 
                   MEAN - ( default=off ) Instead of using final bias level from 
                          restart, use average. Can only be used in conjunction with FREEZE 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken. Some 
                          actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the 
                          output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE action 
                          labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z. To take just the 
                          x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all 
                          three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3... 
                 CENTER - The desired centers (equilibrium values) which will be 
                          sought during the adaptive linear biasing. This is for fixed 
                          values 
             CENTER_ARG - The desired centers (equilibrium values) which will be 
                          sought during the adaptive linear biasing. CENTER_ARG is for 
                          calculated centers, e.g. from a CV or analysis. 
                 PERIOD - Steps over which to adjust bias for adaptive or ramping 
             BIAS_SCALE - A divisor to set the units of the bias. If not set, this 
                          will be the experimental value by default (as is done in White 
                          and Voth 2014). 
                   TEMP - The system temperature. If not provided will be taken from 
                          MD code (if available) 
             MULTI_PROP - What proportion of dimensions to update at each step. Must 
                          be in interval [1,0), where 1 indicates all and any other 
                          indicates a stochastic update. If not set, default is 1 / N, where N 
                          is the number of CVs. 
            RESTART_FMT - the format that should be used to output real numbers in 
                          EDS restarts 
            OUT_RESTART - Output file for all information needed to continue EDS 
                          simulation. If you have the RESTART directive set (global or for EDS), 
                          this file will be appended to. Note that the header will be 
                          printed again if appending. 
             IN_RESTART - Read this file to continue an EDS simulation. If same as 
                          OUT_RESTART and you have not set the RESTART directive, the file will 
                          be backed-up and overwritten with new output. If you do have 
                          the RESTART flag set and it is the same name as OUT_RESTART, 
                          this file will be appended. 
                RESTART - allows per-action setting of restart (YES/NO/AUTO)
