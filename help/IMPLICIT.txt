The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - The atoms to be included in the calculation, e.g. the whole 
                          protein.. For more information on how to specify lists of atoms see 
                          \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

              NL_BUFFER - The buffer to the intrinsic cutoff used when calculating 
                          pairwise interactions. 
              NL_STRIDE - The frequency with which the neighbourlist is updated. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
        TEMP_CORRECTION - ( default=off ) Correct free energy of solvation constants 
                          for temperatures different from 298.15 K
