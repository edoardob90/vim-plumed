Short helpfile for action FIND_SPHERICAL_CONTOUR
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the data should be 
                          collected and added to the quantity being averaged 
                  CLEAR - ( default=0 ) the frequency with which to clear all the 
                          accumulated data. The default value of 0 implies that all the data will 
                          be used and that the grid will never be cleared 
          NORMALIZATION - ( default=true ) This controls how the data is normalized 
                          it can be set equal to true, false or ndata. The differences 
                          between these options are explained in the manual page for \ref 
                          HISTOGRAM 
                   GRID - the action that creates the input grid you would like to 
                          use 
                CONTOUR - the value we would like to draw the contour at in the space 
                NPOINTS - the number of points for which we are looking for the 
                          contour 
           INNER_RADIUS - the minimum radius on which to look for the contour 
           OUTER_RADIUS - the outer radius on which to look for the contour 
                  NBINS - ( default=1 ) the number of discrete sections in which to 
                          divide the distance between the inner and outer radius when 
                          searching for a contour 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
             LOGWEIGHTS - list of actions that calculates log weights that should be 
                          used to weight configurations when calculating averages 
          CONCENTRATION - the concentration parameter for Von Mises-Fisher 
                          distributions 
              COMPONENT - if your input is a vector field use this to specifiy the 
                          component of the input vector field for which you wish to use
