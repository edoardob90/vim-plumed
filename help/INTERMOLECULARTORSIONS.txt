The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                   MOLS - The molecules you would like to calculate the torsional 
                          angles between. This should be the label/s of \ref MOLECULES or 
                          \ref PLANES actions. For more information on how to specify 
                          lists of atoms see \ref Group 
                  MOLSA - In this version of the input the torsional angles between 
                          all pairs of atoms including one atom from MOLA one atom from 
                          MOLB will be computed. This should be the label/s of \ref 
                          MOLECULES or \ref PLANES actions 
                  MOLSB - In this version of the input the torsional angles between 
                          all pairs of atoms including one atom from MOLA one atom from 
                          MOLB will be computed. This should be the label/s of \ref 
                          MOLECULES or \ref PLANES actions 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                     NN - ( default=6 ) The n parameter of the switching function 
                     MM - ( default=0 ) The m parameter of the switching function; 0 
                          implies 2*NN 
                    D_0 - ( default=0.0 ) The d_0 parameter of the switching function 
                    R_0 - The r_0 parameter of the switching function 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                 SWITCH - This keyword is used if you want to employ an alternative 
                          to the continuous swiching function defined above. The 
                          following provides information on the \ref switchingfunction that are 
                          available. When this keyword is present you no longer need the NN, MM, 
                          D_0 and R_0 keywords.
